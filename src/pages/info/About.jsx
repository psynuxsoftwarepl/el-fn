        <p>
          Founded in June 2025, Eleqt was born from a bold ambition to redefine how premium India moves. More than just a ride, Eleqt is a statement of elegance, intelligence, and intention.
        </p>
        <p>
          It began with a simple question: What if luxury, sustainability, and smart design could come together to create the perfect urban commute for CXOs, HNIs, and elite travelers?
        </p>
        <p>
          At Eleqt, we offer pre-scheduled, chauffeur-driven rides designed to deliver precision, peace of mind, and unmatched elegance. No last-minute cancellations. No compromises on comfort. Just seamless journeys powered by technology and thoughtful service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rides go beyond transportation; theyâ€™re crafted for comfort, calm, and class. Every vehicle is clean and equipped with thoughtful amenities like refreshments, water bottles, magazines, curated music, and self-controlled climate settings. Every ride is pre-planned, and every chauffeur is trained to uphold professionalism, discretion, and courtesy. Expect crisp interiors, quiet drives, punctual arrivals, and a genuine respect for your time and space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're heading to the airport, attending a boardroom meeting, a daily city ride, or moving between moments in your day; Eleqt brings clarity, quiet, and care to every kilometer.
